# flow-generated-mergedata
# contact-listview-mailing-labels-recipe

This recipe will step you through creating a Flow launched from an Account. The Flow then displays an input for the User to enter text that will not be saved in Salesforce. The Flow then displays Mambo Merge and passes into it the original Account but with the newly entered text added to it (even though it was never saved).

## Instructions
1. Install Mambo Merge from the AppExchange by following these instructions: https://www.mambomerge.com/support/installation-from-appexchange/

2. Use the below button to deploy this repo to your Salesforce to create a new Visualforce Page, new Aura App, and new Opportunity List View Button
